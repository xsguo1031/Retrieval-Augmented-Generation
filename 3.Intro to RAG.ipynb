    "Welcome to the first assignment in the RAG course! In this assignment, you'll build a RAG pipeline using a dataset containing news information from BBC News. The goal is to enable the LLM to retrieve relevant news details from the dataset and use that information to generate more informed responses. The model you'll be using is the [llama-3-1-8b-instruct-turbo](https://www.together.ai/models/llama-3-1), which was trained on data up to December 2023. The idea is to create a RAG system that allows it to include information on events that occurred in 2024.\n",
