    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Measurement**: Figure out the potential costs of running a RAG application.\n",
    "2. **Prompt Improvement**: Enhance your prompts to speed up response times, while finding the right balance between time, performance, and cost.\n",
    "3. **Tracing System**: Set up a system to keep track of the inputs and outputs during interactions with the RAG system.\n",

    "Congratulations on the success of your ChatBot at Fashion Forward Hub! Customers are thrilled with its functionality, which has significantly reduced calls to customer service and increased sales by providing detailed information and personalized fashion suggestions. However, success has brought some challenges that need your attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rising Costs**: As more customers use the ChatBot, operating costs have increased significantly. This issue has caught the attention of directors, who need better cost monitoring. Currently, there's no system in place to identify where these costs are originating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Response Times**: Occasionally, response times are too long for certain user queries, leading to customer dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the RAG expert responsible for this ChatBot, your next task is to address these challenges by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monitoring and controlling costs and response times effectively.\n",
    "2. Enhancing prompts to strike a balance between cost, performance, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish these goals, you will need to develop new functions and refine existing ones in the RAG framework.\n",
