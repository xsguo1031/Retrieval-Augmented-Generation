    "Chunking plays an important role in information retrieval. For example, when building a vector database from a collection of books, different chunk sizes can serve different purposes. Cataloging entire books as single vectors may help in identifying broad themes, but misses specific details. Chunking closer to the paragraph or sentence level enables the retrieval of specific information or concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models typically have limitations on the amount of text they can process at once, known as the \"context window.\" Chunking helps ensure that text inputs remain within these boundaries, allowing models to handle large documents, like novels, by splitting them into smaller sections.\n",

Conversely, the paragraph chunks retrieved—particularly those with a minimum length of 25 words—provide comprehensive information that effectively educates the reader about the history of Git."
